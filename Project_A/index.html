  Atomic Universe is a creative piece that is coded within p5.js. This project explores the movement of atoms, and the tiny particles that make up our world. The large atom in the center serves to represent the world, while the surrounding atoms demonstrate the molecules that make up our world. The particles around the main atom are always moving, but their movement can’t be seen by the human eye in real-life.  In order to create a representation of their real- life movement, keys were used to activate sporadic movements for the mini atoms surrounding the main atom. Furthermore, to create the feeling of space and universe that pertains to the project’s title, there are stars located in the black abyss that is the background to simulate stars while the circles moving across the plane portray meteors.
